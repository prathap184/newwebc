             <h3 id="F">The worst recorded acid rain disaster in history occurred in the mid-20th century, during the height of industrial pollution in North America and Europe. Acid rain reached alarming levels in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily due to the widespread burning of fossil fuels (especially coal), which released sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) into the atmosphere. These pollutants combined with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which then fell back to Earth as acid rain.

While it’s difficult to single out a specific "worst" event, the following regions were severely affected:

               <h3 class="type3"><p>* This region, including parts of East Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic, was one of the most affected by acid rain. The combination of heavy industrialization, coal burning, and weak environmental regulations in the 20th century led to high levels of sulfur dioxide in the air. This caused severe ecological damage, including:</p>
                    <p>     ->Massive die-offs in forests (especially the Krkonoše Mountains)</p>
                    <p>     ->Contamination of lakes and rivers</p>
                    <p>     ->Soil acidification, making land infertile for agriculture</p>
                    <p>* By the 1980s, this area had some of the highest levels of acid rain in the world.</p>

              <div class="type4">The discovery of the extensive damage caused by acid rain in the 1970s and 1980s led to significant environmental legislation in many countries, including the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the United States and similar actions in Europe. These policies significantly reduced sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from industrial sources, leading to a marked reduction in acid rain over time.</div>
